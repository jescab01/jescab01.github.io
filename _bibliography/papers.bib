  title    = "Modeling the role of the thalamus in resting-state functional
              connectivity: Nature or structure",
  abstract = "The thalamus is a central brain structure that serves as a relay
              station for sensory inputs from the periphery to the cortex and
              regulates cortical arousal. Traditionally, it has been regarded
              as a passive relay that transmits information between brain
              regions. However, recent studies have suggested that the thalamus
              may also play a role in shaping functional connectivity (FC) in a
              task-based context. Based on this idea, we hypothesized that due
              to its centrality in the network and its involvement in cortical
              activation, the thalamus may also contribute to resting-state FC,
              a key neurological biomarker widely used to characterize brain
              function in health and disease. To investigate this hypothesis,
              we constructed ten in-silico brain network models based on
              neuroimaging data (MEG, MRI, and dwMRI), and simulated them
              including and excluding the thalamus, and raising the noise into
              thalamus to represent the afferences related to the reticular
              activating system (RAS) and the relay of peripheral sensory
              inputs. We simulated brain activity and compared the resulting FC
              to their empirical MEG counterparts to evaluate model's
              performance. Results showed that a parceled version of the
              thalamus with higher noise, able to drive damped cortical
              oscillators, enhanced the match to empirical FC. However, with an
              already active self-oscillatory cortex, no impact on the dynamics
              was observed when introducing the thalamus. We also demonstrated
              that the enhanced performance was not related to the structural
              connectivity of the thalamus, but to its higher noisy inputs.
              Additionally, we highlighted the relevance of a balanced
              signal-to-noise ratio in thalamus to allow it to propagate its
              own dynamics. In conclusion, our study sheds light on the role of
              the thalamus in shaping brain dynamics and FC in resting-state
              and allowed us to discuss the general role of criticality in the
              brain at the mesoscale level.",

@ARTICLE{Cabrera-Alvarez2024-AD,
  title    = "A multiscale closed-loop neurotoxicity model of Alzheimer's
              disease progression explains functional connectivity alterations",
  abstract = "The accumulation of amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) and
              hyperphosphorylated-tau (hp-tau) are two classical
              histopathological biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
              However, their detailed interactions with the
              electrophysiological changes at the meso- and macroscale are not
              yet fully understood. We developed a mechanistic multiscale model
              of AD progression, linking proteinopathy to its effects on neural
              activity and vice-versa. We integrated a heterodimer model of
              prion-like protein propagation and a brain network model of
              Jansen-Rit neural masses derived from human neuroimaging data
              whose parameters varied due to neurotoxicity. Results showed that
              changes in inhibition guided the electrophysiological alterations
              found in AD, and these changes were mainly attributed to A$\beta$
              effects. Additionally, we found a causal disconnection between
              cellular hyperactivity and interregional hypersynchrony contrary
              to previous beliefs. Finally, we demonstrated that early A$\beta$
              and hp-tau depositions' location determine the spatiotemporal
              profile of the proteinopathy. The presented model combines the
              molecular effects of both A$\beta$ and hp-tau together with a
              mechanistic protein propagation model and network effects within
              a closed-loop model. This holds the potential to enlighten the
              interplay between AD mechanisms on various scales, aiming to
              develop and test novel hypotheses on the contribution of
              different AD-related variables to the disease evolution.",

@ARTICLE{Cabrera-Alvarez2023-tACS,
  title     = "Understanding the effects of cortical gyrification in tACS:
               insights from experiments and computational models",
  abstract  = "The alpha rhythm is often associated with relaxed wakefulness or
               idling and is altered by various factors. Abnormalities in the
               alpha rhythm have been linked to several neurological and
               psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease.
               Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been
               proposed as a potential tool to restore a disrupted alpha rhythm
               in the brain by stimulating at the individual alpha frequency
               (IAF), although some research has produced contradictory
               results. In this study, we applied an IAF-tACS protocol over
               parieto-occipital areas to a sample of healthy subjects and
               measured its effects over the power spectra. Additionally, we
               used computational models to get a deeper understanding of the
               results observed in the experiment. Both experimental and
               numerical results showed an increase in alpha power of 8.02\%
               with respect to the sham condition in a widespread set of
               regions in the cortex, excluding some expected parietal regions.
               This result could be partially explained by taking into account
               the orientation of the electric field with respect to the
               columnar structures of the cortex, showing that the gyrification
               in parietal regions could generate effects in opposite
               directions (hyper-/depolarization) at the same time in specific
               brain regions. Additionally, we used a network model of spiking
               neuronal populations to explore the effects that these opposite
               polarities could have on neural activity, and we found that the
               best predictor of alpha power was the average of the normal
               components of the electric field. To sum up, our study sheds
               light on the mechanisms underlying tACS brain activity
               modulation, using both empirical and computational approaches.
               Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques hold promise for
               treating brain disorders, but further research is needed to
               fully understand and control their effects on brain dynamics and
               cognition. Our findings contribute to this growing body of
               research and provide a foundation for future studies aimed at
               optimizing the use of non-invasive brain stimulation in clinical
               settings.",
