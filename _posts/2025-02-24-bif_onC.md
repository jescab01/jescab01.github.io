#### Bifurcations in the Jansen-Rit Model Over Parameter C

Neural population models like the Jansen-Rit framework reveal complex dynamical transitions when tuning key parameters.
In this post, I explore how varying C, the average number of synapses connecting subpopulations, leads to fundamental
changes in the system’s fixed points and limit cycles.

#### The Role of Synaptic Coupling (C) in Cortical Dynamics

Parameter C controls the overall strength of synaptic interactions within a cortical column. As C increases, the model
undergoes bifurcations that shift its behavior across different dynamical regimes.

- For low values of C, the system remains near a stable fixed point, with only minor noise-driven fluctuations in
alpha-band activity.
- At intermediate C values (~135), the Jansen-Rit model exhibits a slow limit cycle, where oscillatory activity emerges
but remains constrained.
- Near bifurcation points, we observe the transition from a pre-saddle node regime to a post-supercritical bifurcation,
marking a qualitative shift in the system’s attractor landscape.
- For high C values, the limit cycle expands, producing robust oscillations characteristic of alpha rhythms.

#### Fixed Points, Limit Cycles, and Bifurcations
The interactive figure below visualizes these transitions:

- Fixed points dominate for low C values.
- Limit cycles appear and expand around C ≈ 135, marking the transition from weak fluctuations to sustained oscillatory
activity.
- As C increases further, the oscillatory regime stabilizes, reinforcing the role of synaptic coupling in shaping emergent
neural dynamics.

#### Takeaways and Next Steps
This analysis highlights how intrinsic synaptic coupling (C) governs cortical excitability and transitions between
quiescence and rhythmic activity. Future work could explore how parameter C interacts with external inputs or structural
connectivity to refine predictions about cortical state transitions in health and disease.
