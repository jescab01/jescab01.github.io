#### Exploring Bifurcations in the Jansen-Rit Model with an Interactive Brain Network Simulation

One of the fascinating aspects of brain network models (BNMs) is their ability to capture complex dynamical transitions
observed in empirical brain activity. In the following plot, I explore how the Jansen-Rit modelâ€”originally designed to
simulate cortical column activityâ€”undergoes bifurcations when modulating the coupling factor that scales the weights of
the structural connectivity matrix.

  The interactive figure illustrates the effect of the coupling factor (g) 
  on brain network dynamics using the Jansen-Rit model. The slider at the top 
  controls g, which is represented as a vertical line in the rPLV plot (top middle). 
  As g increases, different brain regions (colored lines) transition through the
  bifurcation at varying levels due to heterogeneity in structural connectivity weights.
  This distribution across the bifurcation highlights how regions exhibit distinct
  dynamical shifts. The bottom row displays a segment of the simulated signals for 
  each region, showing the evolution of oscillatory activity as a function of coupling
  strength. In these simulations, high noisy input to thalamus keeps the cortical nodes oscillating
  in the fixed point regimes.

#### The Role of Coupling in Large-Scale Brain Dynamics

In BNMs, the **coupling factor (g)** determines the strength of interactions between brain regions, based on a
connectivity matrix derived from diffusion MRI (here, using the AAL parcellation). As **g** increases, local neural
populations transition from independent activity to collective dynamics, which can lead to dramatic shifts in
oscillatory behavior.

The interactive visualization above demonstrates this process:

- At **low coupling values**, signals generated by the model are operating in a fixed point regime.
- As **g increases**, long-range inputs alter both spectral properties and the temporal structure of
  the oscillations.
- Around **critical points (bifurcations)**, abrupt changes in signal amplitude and coherence occur, shifting the
  modelâ€™s behavior into a new dynamical regime: the limit cycle.
- These transitions also influence the **functional connectivity (FC)** patterns, where the correlation between
  empirical and simulated FC varies as a function of g.


#### Key Takeaways

- The Jansen-Rit model exhibits **bifurcation points** as a function of structural connectivity scaling.
- Modulating **coupling strength (g)** induces qualitative shifts in neural activity patterns.
- The correlation between empirical and simulated **functional connectivity** dynamically changes across these
  transitions.
