Wellbeing is a multifaceted concept that has been studied across psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy. From a
neuroscientific perspective, understanding the neural correlates of wellbeing can help develop strategies to enhance
mental and cognitive states. In this research line, I aim to explore wellbeing through electrophysiology and brain
stimulation, focusing particularly on the experience of flow and presence.

#### Theoretical Framework: Seligman’s PERMA Model

One of the most comprehensive frameworks for wellbeing is Martin Seligman’s PERMA model. It posits that wellbeing is
composed of five core elements:

1. Positive Emotions – The experience of pleasure, joy, and contentment.
2. Engagement – Deep involvement in activities, closely related to flow.
3. Relationships – Social connections and their impact on mental health.
4. Meaning – A sense of purpose and connection to something larger.
5. Accomplishment – Pursuing goals and achieving mastery.

While all five elements are crucial, my primary interest lies in **Engagement**, particularly in how neuroscience can
elucidate the mechanisms underlying **flow states**.

#### Flow: The Neuroscience of Deep Engagement

Flow, as described by Mihály Csíkszentmihályi, is a state of deep absorption where an individual loses self-awareness
and becomes fully engaged in an activity. This experience, often linked to intrinsic motivation, optimal performance,
and a sense of effortlessness, has been associated with specific neural mechanisms. From a neuroscientific perspective,
flow correlates with altered activity in the default mode network (DMN), leading to a decrease in self-referential
processing, as well as enhanced connectivity in task-positive networks, which facilitates the coordination of
attentional and sensorimotor systems. Additionally, changes in alpha and theta oscillations have been observed, with
alpha synchronization in sensory regions and theta activity in prefrontal and midline structures. These
electrophysiological markers make flow an intriguing phenomenon to study through resting-state EEG/MEG recordings and
task-related neural activity.

#### Brain Stimulation as a Tool to Modulate Flow and Presence

Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), including transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and
transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), provides a potential avenue for enhancing or modulating flow and
presence. By integrating electrophysiological recordings with brain stimulation, this research could contribute to
developing non-invasive interventions aimed at optimizing cognitive and emotional states associated with wellbeing.

#### Future Directions

This research line is under construction.
