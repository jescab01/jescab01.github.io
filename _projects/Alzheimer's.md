#### Understanding Functional Connectivity in Neurodegeneration

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized not only by cognitive decline but
also by widespread disruptions in brain network dynamics. Functional connectivity—how different brain regions
communicate—evolves throughout the disease continuum, from preclinical stages to severe dementia. Understanding these
changes is key to developing early biomarkers and intervention strategies.

#### From Connectivity to Mechanisms: Computational Modeling of AD

The human brain is a complex network, and its dysfunction in AD cannot be fully understood through isolated
observations. Computational models allow us to explore how neurobiological alterations—such as synaptic dysfunction,
neuronal loss, and network disconnection—contribute to the progressive breakdown of functional connectivity. These
models provide a framework for linking neuroimaging findings with underlying neural mechanisms, offering a deeper
insight into disease progression.

#### The Role of Proteinopathy in Brain Dynamics

A hallmark of AD is the accumulation of pathological proteins, such as beta-amyloid and tau, which spread across the
brain in characteristic patterns. But how do these molecular changes translate into altered neuronal activity and
network function? By integrating proteinopathy maps with computational modeling, we can investigate how these
pathological processes shape functional connectivity and contribute to cognitive impairment.

#### Bridging Scales: From Neurons to Whole-Brain Networks

Alzheimer’s research requires a multiscale perspective, connecting microscopic cellular pathology with macroscopic brain
dynamics. Cutting-edge techniques—ranging from large-scale brain simulations to multimodal neuroimaging—are helping to
unravel how local molecular events cascade into system-wide dysfunction. This knowledge is essential for designing
targeted interventions that go beyond symptom relief and tackle the fundamental mechanisms of neurodegeneration.

#### Future Directions: Towards Personalized Models of AD Progression

While group-level studies have provided valuable insights into AD progression, there is a growing need for personalized
approaches. Could we predict an individual’s disease trajectory based on their unique brain network properties? How can
computational models be leveraged to refine therapeutic strategies? The future of AD research lies in combining
neuroimaging, computational modeling, and artificial intelligence to develop individualized disease predictions and
interventions.

#### Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) as a Potential Therapeutic Approach

Given the widespread network dysfunction in AD, non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, such as transcranial
magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tDCS), have emerged as potential tools to
restore normal functional connectivity patterns. These techniques modulate cortical excitability and network dynamics,
potentially counteracting the disruptions observed in AD. By integrating NIBS with computational models of brain
activity, we can refine stimulation protocols to target specific network alterations and explore their efficacy in
slowing cognitive decline.
