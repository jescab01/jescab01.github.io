In the following plot, I explore how the Jansen-Rit modelâ€”originally designed to simulate cortical column activityâ€”undergoes bifurcations when modulating the coupling factor that scales the weights of the structural connectivity matrix.</p> <div> <iframe width="100%" height="900" src="/assets/html/Criticality_th_noisy_phetero.html" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> <div class="caption"> The interactive figure illustrates the effect of the coupling factor (g) on brain network dynamics using the Jansen-Rit model. The slider at the top controls g, which is represented as a vertical line in the rPLV plot (top middle). As g increases, different brain regions (colored lines) transition through the bifurcation at varying levels due to heterogeneity in structural connectivity weights. This distribution across the bifurcation highlights how regions exhibit distinct dynamical shifts. The bottom row displays a segment of the simulated signals for each region, showing the evolution of oscillatory activity as a function of coupling strength. In these simulations, high noisy input to thalamus keeps the cortical nodes oscillating in the fixed point regimes. </div> <h4 id="the-role-of-coupling-in-large-scale-brain-dynamics">The Role of Coupling in Large-Scale Brain Dynamics</h4> <p>In BNMs, the <strong>coupling factor (g)</strong> determines the strength of interactions between brain regions, based on a connectivity matrix derived from diffusion MRI (here, using the AAL parcellation). As <strong>g</strong> increases, local neural populations transition from independent activity to collective dynamics, which can lead to dramatic shifts in oscillatory behavior.</p> <p>The interactive visualization above demonstrates this process:</p> <ul> <li>At <strong>low coupling values</strong>, signals generated by the model are operating in a fixed point regime.</li> <li>As <strong>g increases</strong>, long-range inputs alter both spectral properties and the temporal structure of the oscillations.</li> <li>Around <strong>critical points (bifurcations)</strong>, abrupt changes in signal amplitude and coherence occur, shifting the modelâ€™s behavior into a new dynamical regime: the limit cycle.</li> <li>These transitions also influence the <strong>functional connectivity (FC)</strong> patterns, where the correlation between empirical and simulated FC varies as a function of g.</li> </ul> <h4 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h4> <ul> <li>The Jansen-Rit model exhibits <strong>bifurcation points</strong> as a function of structural connectivity scaling.</li> <li>Modulating <strong>coupling strength (g)</strong> induces qualitative shifts in neural activity patterns.</li> <li>The correlation between empirical and simulated <strong>functional connectivity</strong> dynamically changes across these transitions.</li> </ul> <p>Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughtsâ€”feel free to interact with the plot and share any insights or questions! ðŸš€</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="models"/><category term="nmm"/><category term="jr"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[on coupling factor shaping brain dynamics and functional connectivity.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">welcome</title><link href="https://jescab01.github.io/blog/2025/welcome/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="welcome"/><published>2025-02-24T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-24T10:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jescab01.github.io/blog/2025/welcome</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jescab01.github.io/blog/2025/welcome/"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Welcome to My Digital Home</strong></p> <p>Hello and welcome!
